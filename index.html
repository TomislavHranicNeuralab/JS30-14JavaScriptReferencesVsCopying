		// Let's say we have an array
		const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

		// and we want to make a copy of it.
		const team = players;
		console.log(players, team);

		// You might think we can just do something like this:
		team[3] = 'Chane'

		// however what happens when we update that array?
		console.log(players, team);

		// now here is the problem!

		// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

		// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

		// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
		const team2 = players.slice();
		team2[2] = 'Miro';
		console.log(players, team2);

		// one way

		// or create a new array and concat the old one in
		const team3 = [].concat(players);
		team3[1] = 'Miro';
		console.log(players, team3);

		// or use the new ES6 Spread
		const team4 = [...players];

		// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
		team4[0] = 'Miro';
		console.log(players, team4);

		// Copy with Array.from()
		const team5 = Array.from(players);
		team5[0] = 'Mirko';
		team5[1] = 'Slavko';
		console.log(players, team5);

		// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

		// with Objects
		const person = {
			name: 'Wes Bos',
			age: 80
		};

		// and think we make a copy:
		const captain = person;
		captain.number = 99;
		console.log(person, captain);

		// how do we take a copy instead?
		const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 73, age: 12});
		console.log(person, captain2);

		// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

		// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
